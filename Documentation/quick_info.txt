Accounts cannot be deleted, so we can store the information, if you need your information deleted, then you would have to delete it manually via Database or contact an administrator of ProductMe. 

We have only translated the login and registration, since when a company who's based in such countries register, they can contact us, so we can translate everything, just those are the two main pages which would need translation, so we can show that we can do it.
